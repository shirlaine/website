### A Reporting-Tool App

##### Build with Ruby on Rails | Bootstrap| PostgreSql

---

Given the opportunity to lead a team of 3, this project was our capstone project in which we worked with a local media company to automate their reporting process.

**Problem**
The company was spending too much time on generating manual reports for their clients' campaigns statistics.

**Solution**
To automate the process of retrieving those statistics through the use of our app, using the Facebook Graph API.
The company's clients would also be able to log in to view their campaign statistics.

**Highlighted Features**

* As a Super Admin, I can create/edit/delete Users/Clients under specific Admins
* As an Admin, I can retrieve the facebook post statisics via an Access Key Token input through the app
* As an Admin, I can create/edit/delete clients' campaign details and update campaign statistics
* As a Client, I can log in and view updated post statistics for my campaigns

**What I learnt**

As this project was required to be completed within a short sprint(14 days), I learnt to prioritise, essentially detailing out the scope of the project and assigning resources to the most important features.

The key features identified were

* 3 tier authorisation system - Super Admin, Admins and Users
* Retrieval of Facebook Post Stats using Facebook Graph API
* Overall UX/UI for Admins Interface and Client Interface

The team also chose to work remotely, hence the use of version control (Git) was vital to maintaining a master codebase for us to work from. We used Continuous Integration tools (CircleCI), and practiced code reviews on Github before merging to master branch was allowed.
